This is of interest to no one else but me. I merely want to document some work that I've done. I configured a [custom domain](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site) for this GitHub Pages site. I configured both the apex record and the `www` subdomain. I also am enforcing HTTPS. GitHub makes this incredibly easy, and all for free!
