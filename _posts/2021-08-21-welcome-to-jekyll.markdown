Now here's something I've been meaning to do forever: create a personal website. I've had many false starts at this over the years. Most of my attempts used WordPress. My most recent attempt used [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com), albeit the more automated variety with a "supported" theme. As I try to build a professional network, I thought it was time to take this project more seriously. So here is the next, and hopefully final, restart.

I still want to use GitHub Pages to host my site, but I want a little more control. This time I created a site from scratch using Jekyll. GitHub has good [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/creating-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll) for this.

Hopefully I'll be back soon with posts on continuous delivery, backend development, and Bitcoin!
