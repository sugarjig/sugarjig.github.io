I'm a huge fan of [Continuous Delivery](https://continuousdelivery.com/), both the book and the concept. I have put into practice many of its principles and techniques, such as putting everything in version control, automating everything possible, and working in small batches. It has influenced my approach to software projects more than any other material.

David Farley, one of the co-authors, has just come out with a new book, Modern Software Engineering. Farley seeks to answer the question "what is software engineering?" He describes an approach to software that is rooted in the scientific method. He pulls in many of the concepts from Continous Delivery.

I summarize the book here, simply for my own benefit.

## What Is Software Engineering?

### Introduction

To be successful, software engineers need to be experts at learning. In order to do that, we need to adopt the techniques and strategies of science. The scientific method is describes as

- Characterize: Make an observation of the current state
- Hypothesize: Create a description, a theory that may explain your observation
- Predict: Make a prediction based on your hypothesis
- Experiment: Test your prediction

We should think it terms of controlling the variables in our experiments, which will lead to more consistency and reliability. We should think in terms of being skeptical about our ideas. Informal adoption of basic scientific principles is **engineering**.

> **Software engineering** is the application of an empirical, scientific approach to finding efficient, economic solutions to practical problems in software.

An engineering approach is important for two reasons.

1. Software development is an exercise in discovery and learning
2. Our ability to learn must be sustainable

Software engineers must be **experts at learning and experts at managing complexity**.

The term "software engineering" has become devalued. It either means "code" or means something bureaucratic and precedural. It should instead be something that increases your chances of doing a good job.
