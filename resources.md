Here are some links to resources I have found helpful in shaping my craft. They are in alphabetical order, not order of importance.

You might notice that many of these are either written by Martin Fowler or on his website. Fowler has had a huge influence on me and how I approach software development. Other big influences have been Robert "Uncle Bob" Martin, Jez Humble, and David Farley.
