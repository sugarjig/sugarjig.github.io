I have been working in the software industry for over 13 years, and have worked on many different platforms, from Java Enterprise Edition and Oracle Database on Sun Solaris, to Android, to ASP.NET Core on Azure. On every project, I always wanted to improve things. I was never satisified with the quality. Somewhere along the way, I found [Martin Fowler's website](https://martinfowler.com) and got sucked in. His articles covered so many of the problems I saw on my own teams, and he provided solutions I could apply immediately. Soon after that I read [Continuous Delivery](https://continuousdelivery.com) by Jez Humble and David Farley, and there was no turning back. Now I'm addicted to helping software teams improve. No matter the situation, no matter how the team is performing, I want to help make it better.

Some of the ways I've helped teams are:

- Introduced version control to a team that was not using any
- Introduced continuous integration to a team that was not practicing it
- Migrated a database from one vendor to a completely different one, with no service disruption
- Implemented a continuous integration pipeline with comprehensive autmoated UI tests for a mobile app
- Implemented an automated deployment pipeline for a team using a manual, error-prone process

On every team, I advocate for continuous delivery principals, such as comprehensive automation and building quality in, and patterns, such as using trunk-based development, feature toggles, and branch by abstraction. The result is happer teams and happier customers.

Despite my interest in continuous delivery, I still consider myself a software engineer first. I have a broad range of experience, primarily on backend systems and RESTful APIs. I value well-architected, testable code, and I don't trust my own code unless I've written tests!

In addition to my day-to-day work, I am interested in Bitcoin and its many technological and economic innovations.
