title: About Me
---

I'm a software engineer focused on backend, APIs, and continuous delivery. I have 14 years of professional experience. I started my career as a defense contractor. I currently work at a client services agency, which serves many brands in different business verticals.

No matter the platform or the business, my main goals are to __provide value__ and __help teams perform better__. I advocate for [continuous delivery principles](https://continuousdelivery.com/principles/), such as comprehensive automation and building quality in, as well as patterns, such as trunk-based development, feature toggles, and branch by abstraction.

- Led a team building a mobile app's backend in ASP.NET Core on Azure
- Led a multi-month database vendor migration with no service disruption, saving countless hours of maintenance and operations time
- Implemented an automated pipeline with comprehensive automated UI tests for a mobile app, decreasing the regression time from days to hours
- Implemented an automated deployment pipeline for a website, decreasing release time from hours to minutes
- Experience using many different platforms, including Java EE with Oracle and MySQL, Android, Go, ASP.NET Core on Azure, and PHP on AWS

In addition to my day-to-day work, I am interested in [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/en/) and its many technological and economic innovations.

When I get free time, you can find me spending it with my wife and two boys. Occasionally I‚Äôll do some work on my house.
